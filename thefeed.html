                <p>And now, revealed to all the world, is the reason why it takes me so long to get ready. Slither, by Velvet Revolver, and mindless scrolling on Instagram. Shameless plug for where I work.</p>

                <p>Two disappointing messages. Anita can't join us, and Ellie and I are taking longer to get ready than anticipated, so I give Ryan the tragic news that our time of departure has been pushed back to 10:30.</p>

                <p>We took octavia to the closest freeway entrance, 101 to 380, 380 to 280, 280 to 92, and 92 to 35 (I want to sound like a literal dad so badly and flex being a bay area native). The Kings Canyon Art Fair is in a beautiful part of the redwoods, actually in one of my favorite areas to show people. Very excited to check out local artists and feel proud of myself for several hours.</p>

                <p> I called my mom to see if I could surprise my family in Half Moon Bay with a visit later, to which she replies "eles estao aqui agora." Good thing I called, or I would've knocked at a house where nobody was home. I also bought a little print-out from some artists who cast lasers through bits of glass, and my bank very kindly reminded me in case I forgot.</p>

                <p>I fear her, and yet I am drawn to her as well. I post Donna on my Instagram story to show hundreds of people how brave I am. I also go through my camera roll and find a picture from when Ellie, Ryan, Anita, and I went to the Palace of Fine Arts. I think it looks kind of cool. I might post it.</p>
